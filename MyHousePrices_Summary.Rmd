### Summary

My strategy was

1. preprocessing: imputation of missing values
2. feature engineering: create a new variable
3. encoding categorical features: change levels into numeric values
4. remove some variables with low correlation with the response
5. gradient boosting model with log(response) 
6. predictions on test set  

### Non-standard R packages

* gbm (an algorithm that build an ensemble of weak successive trees with each tree learning and improving on the previous. When combined, they produce a powerful result)
